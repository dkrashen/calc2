We've covered a lot of new material since the last exam, and I thought it would be helpful to recommend some videos for extra practice in reinforcing the concepts we have gone over. I've put a list of some which look particularly good to me below. You are certainly not required to go over each video (though it's not a bad idea!), but I strongy encourage you to use these to reinforce any of the concepts which might not be totally secure in your mind.

###Sequences

- [Definition of sequences][defns] (see [lecture 24][l24], [lecture 25][l25])
- [The Geometric sequence][geomseq]

For convergence of sequences, one of our main tools has been converting it to a limit about functions, and using L'hopital's rule. Other examples we did by using the squeeze/sandwich theorem.


###Series

(this is mostly covered in [lecture 26][l26])

- [Sigma notation for summation][sigma]
- [Introduction to series as the sum of a sequence][series]
- [Example of writing a series in sigma notation][seriessigma]
- [Geometric Series][gseries]
- [The formula for a finite geometric series][gform]
- [The formula for an infinite geometric series][ginfform]
- [Convergence and divergence of geometric series][gsconv]

###Power Series

- [Power Series and Radius of Convergence][pow] (see [lecture 27][l27], and [lecture 28][l28])
