Congratulations on a great semester!

All grades are now available online, for the final exam as well as the course. I was very pleased with how people did on the final exam. There were some difficult problems, and overall, they were handled well. It was clear that a lot of effort was put into reviewing the material. good job!

You can see the grade distribution below for the final exam (your score is available on [eLC][elc]), and your class scores should be available on [Athena][athena].
