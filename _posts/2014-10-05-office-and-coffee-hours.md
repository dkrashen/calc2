As I mentioned in class, we now have two happy announcements:

- Regular office hours will now be Tuesday after class, 2-3pm in my office, Boyd 437.
- Every Friday, starting with this one, I'll be hosting a "coffee hour" in Boyd 308 (aka "the Matrix"), from 11:30am to 12:30pm, featuring espresso/lattes and snacks, until they run out!
