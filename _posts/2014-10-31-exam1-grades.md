Some comments

 - Overall, good job! I'm pretty pleased with the performances overall.
 - if you in the C range, keep in mind that the material has a habit of accumulating. You will need to proactively stay ahead to make sure you don't fall behind!
  - If you are in either the D or the F range, it is extremely important that you make an appointment with me to get a strategy for the remainder of the course
