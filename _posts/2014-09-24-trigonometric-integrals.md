I've opted to, instead of posting an optional practice assignment on webwork, to just put the standard assignment for next week online early (due October 3). This assignment will cover:

- integration by parts (section 8.1)
- trigonometric integrals (section 8.2)
- trigonometric substitutions (section 8.3)

although we haven't yet covered Trigonometric substitutions formally, they are actually just a particular example of what we have been calling "unorthodox u-substitutions." I'll give some more details in lecture tomorrow.

in order to reinforce the trigonometric integrals we have already done, I recommend watching the videos I have online on YouTube:

- [Trigometric Integrals Video][video]

Many of these types of integrals look hard at first glance - it's only after taking them apart slowly one at a time that you get a feeling for how to work them. Just keep going, and don't get stuck. There's always something else to try!
