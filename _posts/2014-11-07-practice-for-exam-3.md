This message might look somewhat familiar from previous posts...

Exam 3 is coming up next week, Thursday in class! 

The practice sheet is available below -- as usual, the problems on the practice sheet may be somewhat comparable to the ones which will be on the exam, however, overall the practice sheet is significantly longer than the actual exam.
