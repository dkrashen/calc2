As was mentioned in class, the exam dates have been adjusted, and I've decided that the optimal new exam dates are as follows (somewhat different than the dates that were proposed in class!):

	Exam 1 : Thursday, September 18
	Exam 2 : Thursday, October 16
	Exam 3 : Thursday, November 13
	
Please make a note in your calendars!

Of course, the final exam schedule is dictated by the registrars office and is:

	Final Exam : Thursday, December 11, 12:00 - 3:00 pm
	

All exams, including the final, are in the standard lecture room : Hardman Hall 102

Here's the [revised syllabus][revised-syllabus].
