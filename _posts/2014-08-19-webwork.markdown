You can access our class WebWork page at:
[https://webwork.math.uga.edu/webwork2/Math2260_Krashen_F14/][webwork]

The first time you go to the WebWork address, you will be given a warning
about the security, for example “This connection is untrusted,” or similar.
Please ignore this and continue (i.e. choose "continue" or “proceed” or “I
understand the risks”, etcetera).

**logging on** works like this:

    login: 810123456
    password: (myid)


To log into the system, your username is your myid (i.e. if your uga email
is person@uga.edu, then your username is “person”) Your password is the
first nine digits of your 810 number (or 811 number as the case may be),
written _together without dashes_. 
For example, your password will look something like: 810123456. This might
mean that you are omitting the last digit of your card (which might
actually be 8101234561, for example).
